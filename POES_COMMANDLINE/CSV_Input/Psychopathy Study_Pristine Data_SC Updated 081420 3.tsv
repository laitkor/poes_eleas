I would feel in pain for a little bit but then try focusing more on the rest of the project without any distractions so I don't hit my finger.	I think my neighbor would feel bad and try to help in whatever way but then realize that I am fine physically and mentally and we would both continue on.	"I would feel disappointed and sad because of all my hard work practicing, but I would want my friend to continue to finish the race."	"My friend would probably feel sad for me because of how distraught I am, but I would be fine until they finished the race if they choose to."	"I would feel a little bit concerned because of multiple instances of people jumping off a bridge. On the other hand, I do not want to assume, but I would hope they are at peace and just looking down at the view below. "	"The other person would maybe feel at peace at the calming water below, scared because of the height from where they are and the bottom, or possibly sad."	"I would feel a little disappointed at first, but I would try my best to keep an open mind and understand what they see wrong with my performance to try to improve it as best as possible. "	My boss would feel disappointed until my actions prove them wrong.	"I would feel slightly annoyed if I was in a rush, but I would not want to make a scene by complaining or making any remarks. Just keep it to myself and realize how small of a deal that is."	The person in front of me would probably feel stressed and concerned about their complicated transaction.	I would feel really happy with the reassurance especially if I thought I worked really hard and submitted my best work.	My boss would feel happy especially if it benefited them to begin with.	I would feel bummed but its not that big of a deal and I would try my best to avoid this circumstance next time for my health and financial reasons.	"My dentist would feel a little bummed too especially since every visit they reinforce the best ways to avoid cavities, but in the end they would not care that much."	"I would feel happy they invited me, but if I intend to go out to eat I would eat whatever feels best for me that day, but keep in mind what my doctor said."	"My colleague would feel happy that I chose to go out with them, and should not care what I eat or what I don't eat."

"I would feel embarrassed that I missed the nail, but also in a lot of pain because the hammer hit my finger.  "	I would hope the neighbor would feel sympthatic and help me as soon as they saw what had happened.	I would feel horrible.  All that preparation and hard work to not finish just before the finish line.  Can I not crawl to the finish line?  I would definitely try.	"I think my friend would feel badly for me, if we have had trained together so much it would be hard to see someone not complete the task. "	"I would feel scared.  I would want to stop the car, I might be wrong but my first intuition is that person is in danger."	I think they feel helpless or they are just looking over at the water for a stupid reason to see something closer but i think that position is scary and not a good idea unless you are thinking of doing something dangerous.	it depends on how much effort I put into the work.  If i knew my work was not living up to the standard I would feel that it was dererved but if I knew that I had been giving it 100% I would feel angry.	I think my boss is bummed that they have to tell me i'm doing poorly.  It is never fun to tell someone that what they are doing is not good enough.	Depends on how busy my day was.  Most likely I would not feel upset.  I understand things need to get done no matter how complex they are.	I would think the person would feel like they had to get the transaction done no matter if it is long or short. They might be busy too and feel annoyed it takes a long time.	"I would feel fantastic! hard work pays off and you are told by your boss that it was great, what better thing!"	"I think they feel happy too, the work is something they can show off too."	I would feel very annoyed and afraid. I hate the dentist and I would be disappointed in myself for the cavities.	"I would think the dentist would feel nothing, its their job."	I would feel compelled to go.  One fatty meal will not kill me and I LOVE PIZZA.	"My colleague would feel happy, that we were going to lunch together!"	"I would feel very disappointed and angry.  If we had agreed to do something together and they changed their mind, they should have actually called me first to tell me instead of me calling days later to find out."	I am sure my friend would feel scared to tell me that they  had changed their mind and also feel sad that it didn't work out.	I would feel that that person is even more attractive and intelligent not to use his family for money.  I would be happy though we would not have to struggle.	A sense of relief my partner would feel like they were living the 100% truth of who they were.	0	0	1	0	2	3	1	2	2	1	0	3	0	3	2	2	2	3	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	1	2	0	0	3	1	3	3	1	1	3	3	3	3	2	2	1	1	3	3	2	3	0	3	2	3	3	3	3	4	2	4	3	3	2	2	1	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	5	4	2	3	2	3	2	3	2	2	2	-2	2	2	2	-2	-2	1	1	3	0	-2	1	-2	1	1	-2	1	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	1	3	1	2	1	3	1	1	3	1	1	3	1	5	2	4	3	3	5	1	2	4	3	4	3	4	5	1	3	1	4	4	1	4	1	1	4	1	1	4	3	4	5	1	1	4	0	0	2	0	4	2	0	1	0	0	2	0	3	4	4	0	2	0	0	2		2	3	2	28	12	0	39	24	35	20	5	10	29	17	10	14	53	38	4	9	14	4	-4	4	-2	0	22	0	58386	Unknown	WB7QJG-61	35	67.4	76	ÊHighest	3	ÊLowest	515	94.3	3	1	22	3	0	19	3	1	41	2	0	30	2	0	28	2	0	58	4	0	25	2	0	42	4	0	67	3	1	44	2	0	31	3	1	75	2	0	27	4	0	36	4	0	63	2	0	22	3	0	15	3	0	37	4	0	21	1	0	11	4	0	32	3	1	17	3	0	12	3	1	29	4	0	39	4	0	26	5	0	65	3	0	30	4	0	18	4	0	48	30	28	35	1	5	15

The person would most likely feel very upset and dejected about their current life and feel as though their life is not worth living.	I would feel upset but also determined to make it better.	Probably upset but since they personally came and talked to me about it I would know they cared about me and still valued me - if it was that terrible they could've fired me.

Most likely stressed because they have a very complicated transaction.	I would feel accomplished and proud of myself.	My boss would maybe feel proud of their own management skills but maybe proud of me too.	I would feel bummed out but also like I need to do something about it.	They probably wouldn't feel a lot about the situation because it is part of their job to fix my teeth.

I would feel bummed because I was probably pretty excited about this business adventure. But then I would try and see the bright side.	"My friend would probably feel stressed about having to back out, but also relieved that they don't have this weighing them down anymore."	"I would feel lied to and wonder whether or not this is someone I really want to marry. If she had been in a prior relationship that really scarred her because they tried to take advantage of her, then I would try to understand."	She would probably be really scared about how I am about to react to her telling me this new information. She may feel as though things might not work out.	0	0	2	3	3	2	0	3	3	3	0	3	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	0	0	3	3	1	3	2	2	3	0	3	2	0	3	3	3	3	1	0	3	3	3	3	2	1	2	2	3	3	3	3	0	3	0	3	3	3	3	5	1	5	1	5	1	1	1	5	3	1	3	1	5	1	5	5	4	5	1	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	1	1	3	3	3	1	1	3	1	2	0	2	-3	-3	-1	-3	-3	2	3	3	1	2	3	1	1	0	1	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	1	2	1	1	2	1	3	1	1	1	1	3	1	1	1	1	5	5	5	1	4	5	5	4	4	3	4	5	5	5	1	2	4	4	4	1	4	2	5	2	2	1	5	2	5	5	1	2	4	0	0	3	0	4	0	0	4	1	0	0	0	3	2	4	0	0	0	0	1	brandongood@email.arizona.edu			0	25	4	0	46	13	28	13	5	10	24	13	21	18	53	43	3	3	18	4	6	8	-11	14	27	3	59993		PMQFL4-115	33	49.7	73	 Highest	9	 Highest	503	93.8	4	0	26	3	1	26	4	1	52	3	1	22	4	1	24	4	1	46	2	0	23	3	1	24	3	1	47	2	0	11	3	1	33	3	1	44	4	1	63	2	0	10	4	1	73	3	0	8	3	0	17	3	0	25	3	1	15	0	0	20	3	1	35	3	1	43	3	0	17	3	1	60	3	1	24	3	1	23	3	1	47	3	1	44	3	0	30	3	1	74	30	27	33	0	5	8

I would feel upset and a bit disappointed because I would have been very excited to start a business venture with my friend.	My friend might feel bad or upset because they might feel that they are letting me down.	I would feel happy because now I wouldn't have to worry about losing my job or my income changing and I would be able to live a happy life with my true love.
